/*
The remainder operator, %, can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by
using % 2 to see whether itâ€™s divisible by two.

Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to these descriptions: a) Zero
is even, b) One is odd, c) for any other number N, its evenness is the same as
N - 2.. The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number)
and return a Boolean. Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1, and try to
fix it.
